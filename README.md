The enemies can also shoot arrows and fireballs (collectively called as 'Projectiles')

Shree Ram's arrow when collide with the projectiles of the enemies, they cancell/neutralize each other


HealthBar is also added, Rama's health decreases by certain amount when a projectile hits him, but decreases to straight zero when an enemy hits him.(quite realistic?)
So you might hit a projectile, but avoid enemy at all costs!!
